# Installation and Configuration of ElsaticSearch

ElasticSearch changed it's License, so it's not Opensorce any more. So we chose _OpenDistro for ElasticSearch_ 
instead, located at `https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/`. Configuration is available in the locally 
available file `values.yaml`.
